# Project Description

This project contains our final submission for a tile-matching game environment framework, as well as the implementation for two tile matching games: Columns and Bejeweled. The game logic that handles each of the games can be found in their respective directories (for example `tmge/game/bejeweled`). The framework and logic the tile-matching games were built upon can be found in the `tmge/game/base` directory. 

This application uses Java 16. It also uses components of the Java Swing package for the implementation of its user interface. 

You are currently in the `framework` branch. This branch contains the interface upon which games can be built. In order to play the demo games built using this framework, please access the `implementation` branch, and follow the instructions listed there.
